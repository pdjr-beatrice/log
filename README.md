# log

This repository contains code implementing the automated ship's
log used on BEATRICE OF HULL.

Implementation of a working log system requires a `loghost`
(typically a Raspberry Pi) on the vessel whose activity is being
logged and a WordPress site somewhere which is responsible for
displaying log data.
