# NAME
#   log-positions - generate a list of position coordinates from one or more
#   log files.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   log-positions logfilespec...
#   log-positions -h
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   logfilespec is a log file specifier of one of three types:
#
#   YYYY selects all the log files for the specified year;
#   YYYYMM selects all the log files for the specified month;
#   YYYYMMDD selects the log file for the specified day.
#
#   The selected log files are concatenated and filtered to extract position
#   coordinates which depict the vessel's track.  The first entry in each log
#   file is assumed to be the overnight position and is taken as the first
#   position.  Subsequent positions are identified as those recorded between
#   ENGINE State 1 and ENGINE State 0 log entries - a heuristic designed to
#   eliminate any spurious position data resulting, for example, from movement
#   whilst moored or at anchor.
#
#   The script outputs records of the form:
#
#   { "latitude": lat, "longitude": lng, "date": "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ" }
